# Fetch the Keg Ride

The [Hop Garden](https://www.thehopgarden.net/) is one of our beverage sponsors for the Madison Bikes Bike Week Party! But how are we going to get the keg from Paoli to Brittingham Park?? You guessed right: By bike! Meet at Crazylegs Plaza (Regent/Monroe intersection) for a 5:30pm (sharp) departure. Weâ€™ll ride the SW Path and Badger State Trail to the Hop Garden at a leisurely pace (12 mph) and after a beverage/food break return the same way. Rain or shine. Distance is about 27 miles. If you want to go faster or slower, that's cool. Route is all on off-street paved paths except for the last section, which is on shoulderless country roads with light to moderate traffic and some hills. Please bring lights.
